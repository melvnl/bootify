## Overview

This is not a Spotify replacement, Spotify offers much more immerse and a greater music experience. Bootify serves it's purpose as an alternative version for people who are broke/stingy enough to pay. I create this project to replace Youtube as my music player when I work out.

## YouTube has an API?

Yup! With YouTubeâ€™s API, you can do things like manage your videos, access analytics, fetch requested video, and etc. See the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs)

## Pros

FREE ðŸ’¸

## Cons 

- Consume more internet data instead (approximately 5Mb for every minute the song is being played), while approximately Spotify only consume 2mb every 3 minutes you play a song. This can happen due to the fact that Bootify actually render an embedded video from YT but hidden from the application client interface.
- Projects that enable the YouTube Data API have a default quota allocation of 10,000 units per day, search request cost 100 units, see for [more](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota)
